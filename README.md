# Exp 5 Physical Design of a 4-Bit Up-Down Counter

## Aim:

Execute floorplanning, power planning, and placement for the synthesised 4-bit up-down counter design.

## Tool Required:

Physical Design: Innovus

## Mandatory Inputs for PD: 

1. Gate Level Netlist [Output of Synthesis]
   
2. Block Level SDC [Output of Synthesis]
   
3. Liberty Files (.lib)
   
4. LEF Files (Layer Exchange Format)
   
## Procedural Steps:

Ensure the Synthesis for the target design is complete, and then open a terminal from the corresponding workspace. 

• Initiate the Cadence tools and cmd:innovus (Press Enter) 

• For Innovus tool, a GUI opens, and the terminal also enters the Innovus command prompt, where the tool commands can be entered. 

After importing the Design, Perform the following Physical Design stages:
